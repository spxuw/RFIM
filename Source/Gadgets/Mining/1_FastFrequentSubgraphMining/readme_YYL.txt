FFSM supports graph databases that contain maximal 32k graphs; each graph may have up to 32k nodes. There may be no more than a total of 80 distinct labels for nodes and edges combined together. Single-node patterns are not included in results. The current software is confined to performance comparison only; full functional one is available upon request. The executable is provided "as it is" and we assume no responsibility for any damage that it may cause to your system/files."

What do you mean by "There may be no more than a total of 80 distinct labels for nodes and edges combined together."????
